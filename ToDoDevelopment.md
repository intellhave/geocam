# Development To Do #

  * Move code section to src-
  * Gui issues
    * Allow the first person and map views to be up simultaneously (2D)
    * Allow external and first person view simultaneously (3D)
    * Show direction of viewer in the non-first person views (2D/3D)
    * Allow user to specify file input (2D/3D)
    * Choice of coloring pattern (2D/3D) and transparency (3D)
  * Implement geodesic so that we can put in moving objects and move (2D/3D)
  * Moving objects
  * Moving viewer
  * Better interaction of diameter with field of view (for instance, we would like to have an example where we cannot see all of the surface)
  * An example of a sinusoidal surface (generate with Mathematica?)
  * Optimize running time
  * Consider lighting issues
